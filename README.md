# Transaction Wallet

This is a transaction wallet where people can transfer ether and buy products. It consists of three types of user: admin, consumer, merchant. To join this wallet, user(consumer/merchant) must request admin to create an account. Admin can approve/ rerject users. Once approved by admin, an user becomes a part of this wallet and can update his details and transfer ether among his peers who are also approved users. To start this transaction, an user must transfer money from his account to this wallet. He can later withdraw this money. An user can also delete his account. 

Working on a yet another functionality where a merchant can display a set of products. Only approved consumers will be allowed to buy those. The contract would make sure that both seller and buyer remains true to their agreement.
